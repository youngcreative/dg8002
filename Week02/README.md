Week 2 assignment for DG8002 Digital Media Environments at [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://torontomu.ca)


## Inspiration

Bark is a transformer-based text-to-audio model created by Suno. Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio — including music, background noise and simple sound effects. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying.

This project is a custom demo of the Bark demo at https://github.com/suno-ai/bark
